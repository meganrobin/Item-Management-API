Peer Review comments 
- adding a created_at or updated_at timestamp column
    - made changes in the player, item, and enchantment table when creating a new object (players.py, items.py)
- API only supports creation and deletions of items/enchantments, not updates
    - updates to items are not relevant since the columns are pretty vague and if changes needed to be made, it makes more sense to create a new item instead
    - for enchantments it makes more sense to be able to edit its effect_description (items.py)
- adding endpoints to list all items GET /items and enchantments GET /enchantments
    - implemented in items.py with GET /items and GET /enchantments
- setting the name field to be unique
    - done by updating the tables with a unique constraint
- changed the player_id, item_id, enchantment_id to autoincrement and into an int in the alembic revisions
- optional filtering for item_type and rarity is now implemented with GET /items
- the 201 status code already indicates success so a server status response is not implemented
- changed player/{player_id}/inventory/{item_id} to patch instead of delete (player.py)
- added constraint to prevent negative quantities in player_inventory_table
- added CHECK constraint to rarity and item_types for item table in the alembic revisions
- current API design does not support retrieving a list of all enchantments for a specific player
    - not implemented since /players/{player_id}/inventory will tell the player what enchantments are equipped to what item
    - enchantments are not stored in the player's inventory without being attached to an item
- unique is added to players usernames and is not allowed to be NULL
- player_inventory_item_id field created and the affected tables are changed to reflect this (items.py, players.py)
- most schema columns are changed to ints except enchantment_effects since their purpose is to describe its effects
- enchantments are purposely separated from the item since this encourages the player to go around the game, therefore there is not a way to enchant an item not in a players_inventory
- damage isn't accounted for since this project is only for inventory items
- creating a new players with a username was implemented prior to V3 deadline
- schema should have a notion of item "slot"
    - not implememted since it doesn't matter where items are in a player's inventory right now
    - it is sufficient to be list
- implemented ability for user to de-enchant an item (players.py)
    - added a DELETE endpoint /{player_id}/inventory/{item_id}/enchantments
- In your enchantments table, in addition to an effect_description, it could be nice to include specific numerical stats as well
    - not implemented as the enchantments increases an items strength by a fixed amount to ensure fairness
- The first issue I can see is that every item is only allowed to have one enchantment in this current model because item_id is a unique primary key and player_id is also a unique primary key
    - an item is purposely allowed to only have one enchantment which is why the table is setup like this
    - to prevent an item from having too many benefits
- have rarity be a part of the playerInventoryItem table
    - since rarity is already part of an item, this is not necessary since the rarity can be pulled from a LEFT JOIN
- putting name under PlayerInventoryItem table would also be good
    - also not implemented since items are not meant to be customizable, since it would most likely change every game
- I think each item type should have only certain enchantments associated with it. I think creating an itemTypeEnchantments table that has an item_type and enchantment_id column could be a good way of organizing this data
    - not implemented since it allows for more player creativity and let them decide how they want to enchant an item
- Allowing for an ORDER BY argument would be good
    - implemented in /players/{player_id}/inventory
- separated enchantments from items.py
