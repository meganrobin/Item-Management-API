User Stories:

1. As a crafting game developer, I want to check which ingredients a player has in their inventory, so that I can process item creation and deduct resources.
2. As a game developer, I want users to be able to upgrade the rarity of their items through an in-game currency, so that players have more opportunities to craft better weapons.
3. As a player behavior engineer, I want to be able to keep track of the most popular weapons, so that I can accurately write reports on which weapons to focus on.
4. As a multiplayer game moderator, I want to reset or remove specific items from the game via the backend if they’re bugged, so that I can maintain fair play.
5. As a player, I want to add enchantments to my weapons, so that there is more variability in the game and allow for more creativity.
6. As a player, I want to keep track of my in-game money, so that I know what items I can buy.
7. As a game developer, I want to implement different rarities of items, so that players are motivated to explore other parts of the game and have interactions with other players.
8. As a gamer, I want to be able to remove items with lower stats from my inventory, so that I can optimize my gaming strategy and reserve space for better loot.
9. As a game developer, I want to have a cap limit for items, so that users cannot have an abundant amount of one item type and the game remains fair.
10. As a game designer, I want to have a database of all weapons, so that I can add new weapons that are unique from current weapon offerings.
11. As a game developer, I want to keep track of each player’s total earnings, so that I can create a leaderboard of players with the most money.
12. As a game developer, I want to have a database of all weapons, so that I can select a weapon at random as a reward for when a player finishes a quest.

Exceptions:

1. Invalid Equipment: When players try equipping stuff that doesn’t work well together such as having two primary weapons. The api should return “incompatible equipment pair error” and explain why it doesn’t work.
2. Slot Already in Use: When a player attempts to wear an item(like a hat), but the item slot is already in use, the player will be notified that they must remove the old item before attempting to wear the new item.
3. Unstackable Items: If a player tries to stack unstackable items(such as legendary weapons), it will notify the player that the item is unstackable and block the stack from happening.
4. Cursed Item: If a player tries to remove a cursed item that isn’t removable, they will be reminded that the item is cursed with a notification.
5. Inventory Full: If a player’s inventory is full and they attempt to add another item, the inventory will give back an error to the user and ask them to either remove an item from their inventory or swap the item they want with an existing item in an inventory slot.
6. Item Enhancement Limit Reached: If a player reaches the maximum amount allowed for an item enhancement, the inventory will give back an error to the user and prevent the user from adding more of that item to their inventory.
7. Item Rarity: If a player attempts to pick up an item of lower rarity than an already existing item in their inventory, the inventory will give back an error to the user and ask them if they are sure that they want to pick up that item.
8. Enchantment Not Applicable: When a user tries to apply an enchantment to an incompatible item, the player will be told which items are compatible with the enchantment they’re trying to apply.
9. Incorrect Ingredients: If the player tries to craft an item but they don’t have the required ingredients to craft it, they will get an error informing them that they can’t craft the item and telling them which ingredients they are missing.
10. Not Enough Money: If a user attempts to buy an item or item enhancement and they do not have enough funds, they will receive an error stating that they have insufficient funds.
11. Too Much Money: If a user attempts to pick up more in-game currency than is allowed, they will receive an error stating that they reached the maximum currency allowed.
12. No Space After Crafting: If a player attempts to craft something that, when crafted, would create more items than inputted and this would exceed their inventory slots, then the player will be told that they cannot craft the item until they remove the required number of items from their inventory.
