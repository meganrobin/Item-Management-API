# Project Description:
For our project, we created a backend API for managing items in multiplayer games. Our backend service contains important item metadata like item ID, item display name, enchantments, weapon attack power, and rarity. Our service keeps track of dynamic, current game data like what items are in each player’s inventory, how many of each item, how many item slots a player has left, and which items are equipped. We provide multiple endpoints for reading important game data and writing to the database to add, remove, or alter items in the current game. This backend is useful for anyone creating a multiplayer video game in which item data is changing and needs to be accessed by each player’s instance of the game.
