# Project Description:
For our project, we will create a backend API for multiplayer fighting games. Our backend service will contain important game data like max amount of players, all item possibilities and their corresponding attributes, and all possible enchantments for weapons. Our service will keep track of dynamic, current game data like number of players in game, location of each player, health of each player, and number of kills. You will be able to read the important game data and write to the database to add players, weapons, and items into the game. This backend will be useful for anyone creating a multiplayer video game in which certain data is changing constantly and needs to be accessed by each playerâ€™s instance of the game.
