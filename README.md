# Project Description:
For our project, we will create a backend API for managing items in multiplayer games. Our backend service will contain important item metadata like item ID, item display name, enchantments, weapon attack power, and rarity. Our service will keep track of dynamic, current game data like what items are in each player’s inventory, how many of each item, how many item slots a player has left, and which item(s) are equipped. You will be able to read the important game data and write to the database to add, remove, and alter items in the current game. This backend will be useful for anyone creating a multiplayer video game in which item data is changing and needs to be accessed by each player’s instance of the game.
